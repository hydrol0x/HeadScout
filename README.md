# HeadScout

## FIRST Robotics scouting statistics

- WIP, made with Electron (React for front-end soon)

## Planned

- For now, import from google sheets (current way our team stores scouting data + automatic integration with google forms)
  - In future create proper backend
- Re-create some simple statistics and features that my team currently uses
- Add more user friendly UI to help pick robots, compare statistics, etc.

## Dev Setup

- Have node.js installed
- In project directory run `npm install`
- To start app run `npm start`
- To restart app run `rs`
